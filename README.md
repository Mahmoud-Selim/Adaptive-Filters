# Adaptive-Filters

This Repository implements `Variable Step-Size LMS Algorithm With aGradient-Based Weighted Average`. It also implements other algorithms such as GVSSLMS, MVSSLMS, VSSLMS and compare the proposed approach in the paper with them.

## Setup
All experiments were run on windows machine with MATLAB2020a.


## Running the script

To run the experiments please use the `run.m` script. It will run the experiment many times and average their results.
